# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-KNN-SVM-and-Logistics-Regression-using-R-Programming
â€”The research includes the performance study of different Machine Learning algorithms on a variety of large datasets. For analysis, these datasets are gathered from different domains including gaming, marketing and educational &amp; learning. The primary objective is to implement and overcome the limitations associated with Machine Learning methods; to evaluate an efficient predictive model. A Decision Tree Classifier is applied on Chess dataset from gaming domain, which consists of records of different chess board positions. Thus, an optimal model is evaluated by pruning the tree parameters. Furthermore, a Random Forest is implemented, after which its accuracy is compared with Decision Tree model and an efficient model is carried forward to predict the class of the dependent variable.
